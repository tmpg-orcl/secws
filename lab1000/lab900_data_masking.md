# Lab 9: Masking Data with Enterprise Manager Cloud Control #

This lab will demonstrate how to use Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Data Masking and Subsetting Pack to discover  and anonymize sensitive data in an Oracle database. The Data Masking and Subsetting Pack is a pre-installed module of Enterprise Manager.

## Requirements ##

Instructions in this lab expect that you have completed all the previous labs in the workshop.

## Introduction  ##

We have already seen that our database contains sensitive data:

![Alt text](./images/img01.png " ")

In this chapter, we will use EM13cR3 Data Masking & Subsetting Pack to anonymize sensitive data before sharing it with developers or third parties.

## Step 1 : Relax network settings for secdb ##

Remove or lower the following network settings on secdb, which Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13cR3 still does not support with a default installation.

````
$ <copy>cd /u01/oracle/db/prod/19c/ee/network/admin</copy>
````

Modify sqlnet.ora on secdb as shown below:

![Alt text](./images/img02.png " ")

## Step 2 : Connect to Enterprise Manager Cloud Control ##

You can then connect to EM13cR3 at the following URL:

**https://&lt EM CC PUBLIC IP &gt:7803/em**

Allow a security exception as we are just using a self-signed certificate and connect as **sysman**, password **MyDbPwd#1**

![Alt text](./images/img03.png " ")

![Alt text](./images/img04.png " ")

![Alt text](./images/img05.png " ")

TIP:  In case of difficulty, create a PuTTY connection to emcc with the same settings as for secdb and using emcc’s public IP and the same private key (and no SSH tunnel).

You can then connect to emcc as oracle and check whether the whole stack has been started by executing:

/u01/oracle/fmw/bin/emctl status oms

Wait until the whole stack is up

![Alt text](./images/img06.png " ")

## Step 3 : Cloning PDB1 ##

We start this exercise by creating a new pluggable database named **MASKED** as a clone of the production pluggable database PDB1. We will later run an **in-database anonymization** of PDB MASKED.

Using a terminal window to secdb, execute mask20_clone.sh to clone PDB1

````
$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab09_masking</copy>
````

````
$ <copy>mask20_clone.sh</copy>

SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Fri Apr 24 14:45:38 2020
Version 19.6.0.0.0
Connected.

SQL> -- clone PDB1 as MASKED
SQL> create pluggable database masked from pdb1 keystore identified by "MyWalletPwd#1";
Pluggable database created.

SQL> alter pluggable database masked open read write;
Pluggable database altered.
````

To mask data and also because we operate in a Database Vault environment, we need to grant additional privileges to SYSTEM on MASKED.

````
$ <copy>mask30_grant.sh</copy>

SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Fri Apr 24 14:49:20 2020
Connected.

SQL> --
SQL> -- the following privileges are required by Data Modeling & Masking
SQL> -- in a Database Vault environment
SQL> --
SQL> alter session set container=masked;
Session altered.

SQL> grant execute on dbms_crypto to system;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> grant execute on dbms_aqadm to system;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> grant execute on utl_file to system;
Grant succeeded.

SQL>
SQL> connect c##dbvo/"_c2h5oh_"@localhost/masked
Connected.
SQL> exec dbms_macadm.authorize_ddl('SYSTEM','DBSNMP')
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
````

To enable advanced masking formats in our database, we also need to run a script, which adds the **DM_FMTLIB** package to the **DBSNMP** schema. The scripts (one for the package definition, the other for the package body) can be found on the EM13cR3 server in the following directory:

* $PLUGIN\_HOME/sql/db/latest/masking/dm\_fmtlib\_pkgdef.sql
* $PLUGIN\_HOME/sql/db/latest/masking/dm\_fmtlib\_pkgbody.sql

These scripts have already been copied to secdb. Please run them by executing the following command.

````
$ <copy>mask35_dm_fmtlib.sh</copy>

(...)
2957  function get_version return varchar2 is
2958  begin
2959     return DM_FORMAT_DRV_VERSION;
2960  end;
2961
2962  END DM_FMTLIB;
2963  /

Package body created.

SQL> SHOW ERRORS;
No errors.
SQL> exit
````

We should now be ready to create an Application Data Model.

## Step 4 : Configure PDB MASKED in Enterprise Manager ##

* Connect to Enterprise Manager (**SYSMAN / MyDbPwd#1**)
* Got to **Setup** > **Add Target** > **Configure Auto Discovery**
* Select **secdb** and click on **Discover now**

![Alt text](./images/img07.png " ")

* Go to **Setup** > **Add Target** > **Auto Discovery Results**
* Select **CONT_MASKED** and **Promote** the PDB

![Alt text](./images/img08.png " ")

*	Enter password for DBSNMP: **MyDbPwd#1**, then click **Next** and **Save**.

## Step 5 : Create the Application Data Model ##

* Go to **Targets** > **Databases** and click on **CONT_MASKED**
*	Go to **Security** > **Application Data Modeling** and click on **Create**.

![Alt text](./images/img09.png " ")

Enter **Name**, **Description** and select Source Database as follows, then click **Continue**.

Select the **HCM** schema and click **Continue** and **Submit** the job immediately.

![Alt text](./images/img10.png " ")

We can now review the Data Model.

* Go to **Targets** > **Databases**
*	Select **CONT_MASKED**
*	Go to **Security** > **Application Data Modeling**, Select **DM_HCM** and **Edit**.

Click on **Referential Relationships** and expand the tree of objects to show the Parent – Dependent relationship automatically detected between **DEPARTMENTS** and **EMPLOYEES** on column **DEPARTMENT_ID**.

![Alt text](./images/img11.png " ")

## Step 6 : Configure sensitive columns ##

We are now going to discover the **sensitive columns** that are good candidates to be anonymized.

Click on the **sensitive columns** tab and in the **Actions** menu, select **Create Discovery Job** and run it immediately.

![Alt text](./images/img12.png " ")

Select all applications and sensitive column types.

![Alt text](./images/img13.png " ")

Click **Continue** and run the job immediately.

From the **Data Model** > **Sensitive columns**, click on **Actions** > **Sensitive Columns Discovery Results**.

![Alt text](./images/img14.png " ")

Four columns are automatically discovered.

![Alt text](./images/img15.png " ")

We now need to confirm the sensitive status of these columns and manually add columns we want to consider as sensitive even if they were not automatically discovered.

Let us start by confirming the status of the automatically discovered columns by selecting them individually and clicking on the **Set Sensitive Status** button to confirm the status as **sensitive**.

![Alt text](./images/img16.png " ")

They should now all show as **sensitive columns**.

![Alt text](./images/img17.png " ")

In many cases, we need to also manually add more sensitive columns.

Click on **Sensitive Columns** and **Add** and add three more columns from **HCM.EMPLOYEES**, then **Save** and Return.

*	EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME
*	EMPLOYEES.LAST_NAME
*	EMPLOYEES.SALARY

![Alt text](./images/img18.png " ")

![Alt text](./images/img19.png " ")

## Step 7 : Configure sensitive columns ##

We are now ready to create a Data Masking Definition applicable on our sensitive columns.

*	Go to **Targets** > **Databases**
*	Select **CONT_MASKED**
*	Go to **Security** > **Data Masking and Subsetting** > **Data Masking Definition**,
* Click **Create**

![Alt text](./images/img20.png " ")

Select the Application Data Model, then click **Add** (columns)

![Alt text](./images/img21.png " ")

Select the schema (**HCM**), click **Search** and **select all** sensitive columns, then click **Add**.

![Alt text](./images/img22.png " ")

You should get the following table of columns to be masked. We can now click on the little wrench icon to define a masking transformation for each column.

![Alt text](./images/img23.png " ")

Let us generate random values for **FIRST\_NAME**, **LAST\_NAME** and **SALARY**. Click on the little wrench and program the following rules:

**FIRST_NAME:**
![Alt text](./images/img24.png " ")

**LAST_NAME:**
![Alt text](./images/img25.png " ")

**SALARY:**
![Alt text](./images/img26.png " ")

Let us use a SQL Expression for **EMAIL** to construct it from the anonymized value of **FIRST_NAME**.

Use the following expression:

````
$ <copy>%FIRST_NAME%||'@myco.com'</copy>
````


**EMAIL:**
![Alt text](./images/img27.png " ")

For **PAYMENTACCOUNTNO**, click on **Import Format**.

![Alt text](./images/img28.png " ")

Select **Generic Credit Card Number Formatted**.

![Alt text](./images/img29.png " ")
![Alt text](./images/img30.png " ")

Similarly, set the following masking formats:

*	**PHONE_NUMBER**: import and use **(US) phone Number Formatted**.
*	**TAXPAYERID**: import **(US) Social Security Number Formatted**.

Then click on OK at the bottom of the screen to save the Data Masking Definition.

![Alt text](./images/img31.png " ")

## Step 8 : Generate and run the masking script ##

Before generating the PL/SQL script, let us review some advanced options.

* Edit **Masking definition**
* Show **Advanced Options**
* Uncheck **Use parallel execution when possible**

![Alt text](./images/img32.png " ")

We can now generate the masking PL/SQL script:

![Alt text](./images/img33.png " ")

![Alt text](./images/img34.png " ")

![Alt text](./images/img35.png " ")

And we are finally ready to execute the masking job by scheduling an immediate execution…

![Alt text](./images/img36.png " ")

In the **Schedule Data Masking Job** screen, be sure to select the following:

* Check **The selected target is not a production database.**

![Alt text](./images/img37.png " ")

* Host & Database Credentials : select the default ones:

![Alt text](./images/img38.png " ")

You can now compare the original and masked data in the database by running the following scripts on secdb:

````
$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab09_masking</copy>
````

````
$ <copy>mask40_view_original.sh</copy>
