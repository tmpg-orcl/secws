## Requirements ##

Instructions in this lab expect that you have completed all the previous labs in the workshop.

## Step 1 : Unzip DBSAT Companion Utilities ##

Run dbsat60_prepare.sh to copy locally previous DBSAT reports and unzip DBSAT companion utilities including the dbsat_diff tool.

````
$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab10_dbsat</copy>
````

````
$ <copy>dbsat60_prepare.sh</copy>

Archive:  dbsat_util.zip
  inflating: work/dbsat_diff
  inflating: work/dbsat_extract
````

## Step 2 : Run DBSAT Collect ##

Enter password **oracle** to protect the output file.

````
$ <copy>dbsat70_collect2.sh</copy>

Database Security Assessment Tool version 2.1 (March 2019)

DBSAT Collector completed successfully.

Calling /u01/oracle/db/prod/18c/ee/bin/zip to encrypt dbsat_pdb1_2.json...

Enter password: oracle
Verify password: oracle
  adding: dbsat_pdb1_2.json (deflated 89%)
zip completed successfully.
````

## Step 3 : Generate a DBSAT Collect report ##

Use again password **oracle** to protect the report.

````
$ <copy>dbsat80_report2.sh</copy>

## Step 4 : Unzip the report file ##

Unzip the report file to be able to check the contents by opening it in Firefox. You will be asked for the password to unzip. Input **oracle** when requested.

````
$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab10_dbsat/work</copy>
````

````
$ <copy>unzip dbsat_pdb1_2_report.zip</copy>

Archive:  dbsat_pdb1_2_report.zip
[dbsat_pdb2_report.zip] dbsat_pdb1_2_report.txt password: oracle
  inflating: dbsat_pdb1_2_report.txt
  inflating: dbsat_pdb1_2_report.html
  inflating: dbsat_pdb1_2_report.xlsx
  inflating: dbsat_pdb1_2_report.json
````

## Step 5 : Compare DBSAT reports ##

You can run dbsat90_compare.sh to generate all the differences between the first DBSAT report and this one.

````
$ <copy>dbsat90_compare.sh</copy>
