# Lab 5: Privilege Analysis

**Privilege Analysis** allows to determine the minimum set of privileges required by a user or role, thus enforcing a least privilege approach.

## Requirements ##

Access to secdb virtual machine.

## Introduction  ##

The Privilege Analysis feature may be helpful to determine the minimum set of privileges required by a user or role. In some cases, it may be possible to substitute a more limited object privilege grant in place of a system privilege grant that applies to all objects.

In our example, we will reduce the privileges granted to **DBA\_NICOLE** to the minimum she really needs.

## Step 1 : Check DBA\_NICOLE's current role ##

**DBA\_NICOLE** is a junior DBA who was initially granted the full **DBA** role. Run the following script from a terminal window to the **secdb** server.

````
[oracle@secdb ~]$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/HOL/lab05_pa</copy>
````

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa10_show_nicole_privs.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Show Nicole's privileges
SQL> --
SQL> select grantee, granted_role from dba_role_privs where grantee = 'DBA_NICOLE';

GRANTEE              GRANTED_ROLE
-------------------- --------------------
DBA_NICOLE           DBA
(...)
````

## Step 2 : Check DBA\_DEBRA can run Privilege Analysis ##

**DBA\_DEBRA** is the main **DBA**. Before beginning, let us make sure she has the **CAPTURE\_ADMIN** role required to execute a privilege analysis.

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa11_show_debra_privs.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Does DBA_DEBRA have the CAPTURE_ADMIN role?
SQL> --
SQL> select sys_context('SYS_SESSION_ROLES','CAPTURE_ADMIN') has_capture_role from dual;

HAS_CAPTURE_ROLE
--------------------
TRUE
(...)
````


## Step 3 : Create a Privilege Analysis job ##

We can now create a privilege analysis job to capture the privileges used by **DBA\_NICOLE**.

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa20_create_capture.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Create a database privilege analysis policy
SQL> --
SQL> begin
  2   dbms_privilege_capture.create_capture(
  3   name  => 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS',
  4   type  => dbms_privilege_capture.g_context,
  5 condition =>  'sys_context(''USERENV'',''SESSION_USER'')=''DBA_NICOLE''');
  6  end;
  7  /
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
SQL> --
SQL> -- Look to see if our capture exists
SQL> --
SQL> select NAME, TYPE, ENABLED from DBA_PRIV_CAPTURES where NAME = 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS';

NAME                      TYPE            ENABLED
------------------------- --------------- ----------
NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS     CONTEXT         N
(...)
````

## Step 4 : Start the capture process ##

**DBA\_DEBRA** can now start the capture process.

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa21_start_capture.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Start privs analysis capture process
SQL> --
SQL> begin
  2   dbms_privilege_capture.enable_capture(
  3     name => 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS'
  4     );
  5  end;
  6  /
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
(...)
````

## Step 5 : Nicole does her work ##

Now that the capture process is running, **Nicole** can connect and do her task. For instance, she may work as some SQL tuning tasks.

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa30_work_nicole.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Do Nicole's work
SQL> --
SQL> explain plan for
  2  SELECT
  3          departments.department_name, COUNT(*) AS staff
  4  FROM
  5          hcm.employees
  6  INNER JOIN
  7          hcm.departments ON departments.department_id = employees.department_id
  8  GROUP BY
  9          departments.department_name;
Explained.
(...)
````

## Step 6 : Stop the capture process ##

When **Debra** is sure **Nicole** has executed a representative subset of her tasks, she can stop the capture process.

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa40_stop_capture.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Status of our capture
SQL> --
SQL> select NAME, TYPE, ENABLED from DBA_PRIV_CAPTURES where NAME = 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS';

NAME                      TYPE            ENABLED
------------------------- --------------- ----------
NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS     CONTEXT         Y

SQL> --
SQL> -- Disable the capture process
SQL> --
SQL> begin
  2    dbms_privilege_capture.disable_capture(
  3    name    => 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS');
  4  end;
  5  /
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> --
SQL> -- Status of our capture
SQL> --
SQL> select NAME, TYPE, ENABLED from DBA_PRIV_CAPTURES where NAME = 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS';

NAME                      TYPE            ENABLED
------------------------- --------------- ----------
NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS     CONTEXT         N
(...)
````

## Step 7 : Generate results ##

**Debra** can now make the following call to generate results.


````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa50_generate_result.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL>
SQL> --
SQL> -- Generate reports
SQL> --
SQL> begin
  2    dbms_privilege_capture.generate_result(
  3    name    => 'NICOLE_PRIVS_ANALYSIS');
  4  end;
  5  /

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
(...)
````

## Step 8 : View results ##

The result of the privilege analysis is accessible by querying a series of specific data dictionary views reporting the system and object privileges and roles actually used.

In the next script, we will select from two of these views (**DBA\_USED\_SYSPRIVS** and **DBA\_USED\_OBJPRIVS**) the **actual privileges** required by **NICOLE** and put them into a new **DBA\_TUNING\_ROLE** role.

We can then revoke **DBA** from **NICOLE** and replace it by this **DBA\_TUNING\_ROLE** granting a more limited set of privileges than those offered by a full **DBA** role.


````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa60_show_used_privs.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> -- Show privileges required by Nicole
SQL> select 'GRANT '||SYS_PRIV||' to dba_tuning_role; ' from dba_used_sysprivs
  2  where username = 'DBA_NICOLE';

GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.XMLSEQUENCE to dba_tuning_role;
GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.XMLTYPE to dba_tuning_role;
GRANT READ ON SYSTEM.PRODUCT_PRIVS to dba_tuning_role;
(...)
````

## Step 9 : Create and grant an ad hoc role to NICOLE ##

Rn the following script to create and grant an ad hoc role to NICOLE

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa70_set_new_role.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> -- Create and grant an ad hoc role to NICOLE
SQL> create role dba_tuning_role;
Role created.

SQL> @/tmp/create_tuning_role
SQL> GRANT EXEMPT REDACTION POLICY to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT CREATE SESSION to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_OUTPUT to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_XPLAN to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_XPLAN_TYPE_TABLE to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT SELECT ON SYS.DUAL to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT SELECT ON SYS.DUAL to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT SELECT ON SYS.PLAN_TABLE$ to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT INSERT ON SYS.PLAN_TABLE$ to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.XMLSEQUENCE to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.XMLTYPE to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.
SQL> GRANT READ ON SYSTEM.PRODUCT_PRIVS to dba_tuning_role;
Grant succeeded.

SQL> revoke dba from DBA_Nicole;
Revoke succeeded.

SQL> grant dba_tuning_role to DBA_Nicole;
Grant succeeded.

## Step 10 : Verify NICOLE can still do her work ##

Finally, we can run verify that Nicole is still able to complete her tasks

````
[oracle@secdb lab05_pa]$ <copy>pa30_work_nicole.sh</copy>

(...)
SQL> --
SQL> -- Do Nicole's work
SQL> --
SQL> explain plan for
  2  SELECT
  3          departments.department_name, COUNT(*) AS staff
  4  FROM
  5          hcm.employees
  6  INNER JOIN
  7          hcm.departments ON departments.department_id = employees.department_id
  8  GROUP BY
  9          departments.department_name;
Explained.

SQL> select * from table(dbms_xplan.display);
